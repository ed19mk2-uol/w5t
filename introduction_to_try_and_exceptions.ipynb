    "Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. They can cause the program to stop running abruptly. For example, dividing a number by zero or entering invalid input can trigger an exception. Without proper handling, these errors crash the program and prevent further execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with **try statements**, we can catch these exceptions and handle them gracefully, allowing the program to continue running. The try statement consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `try` block, where you place code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "- One or more `except` blocks, where you handle specific exceptions that might occur.\n",
